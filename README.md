Assume that someone forget his password and he wants to retreive his password through an algorithm.
This Genetic Alogrithm will generates some random initialized passwords and evolve them into the final original password.
Through the process of evolution, concepts of GA such as fitness, mutation, crossover will be applied to implementation.
